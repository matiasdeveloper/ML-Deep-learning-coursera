Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI

Instructor: Andrew Ng
Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
What I want to say

VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT

As a student and self-taught software developer, I have taken many courses related to computer science, software, videogames, artificial intelligence on different platforms udemy, edx, coursera, udacity, among others.
That is why I understand those people who find it difficult to understand certain content not only because of its complexity. In all platforms there are different internal and external forums that serve to answer doubts and questions, but nevertheless they are small details.
Therefore I give you a small reference. It may save you time looking for solutions and I hope you don't copy the code without understanding it.
This specialization course from deepleerning.ai is wonderful. It is a treasure of humanity so we enjoy the content without copying my work and always understanding what is behind deep learning. Good luck on this beautiful path that is the world of technology.

Currently, this repo has 2 major parts you may be interested in and I will give a list here.
