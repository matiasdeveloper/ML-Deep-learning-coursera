### Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

###### ***Instructor: Andrew Ng***

Repository introduction:

***What do you want to say:***

This repository contains all my work for this specialization. All code base, quiz questions, screenshots, and images are taken from, unless specified, the deep learning specialization at Coursera. 
What I mean. As a student and self-taught software developer, I have taken various courses related to computing, software, video games, artificial intelligence on different platforms udemy, edx, coursera, udacity, among others. That is why I understand those people who find it difficult to understand certain content not only because of its complexity. In all platforms there are different internal and external forums that serve to answer doubts and questions, but nevertheless they are small details. So I give you a little reference. It can save you time looking for solutions and I hope you don't copy the code without understanding it. This specialization course from deepleerning.ai is wonderful. It is a treasure of humanity so we enjoy the content without copying my work and always understanding what is behind deep learning. Good luck on this beautiful path that is the world of technology.

This repository is divided by courses, which in turn each folder of the course subdivided by week contains at least one of these three elements:

- Practice Questions (It has all the practical questions of the week)
- Programming Lab (Developed by coursera and completed by me)
- Python VSCode (It is a section developed outside the coursera platform but with the same content made in python visual studio code)
